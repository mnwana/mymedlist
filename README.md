# My Meds
My Meds is a site built to help patients and health care providers manage medication lists.

## Concept
- ‘My Meds’ allows a patient to be able to store their medication list online, with the ability to update, remove, and save their medication history.
- The benefits of this site include:
    - Decrease duplicate medication therapy
    - Have a list of medications all in one place
